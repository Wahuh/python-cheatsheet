User clicks on start run
send username and start time to server
creates a run item in db
primary key user_id
secondary key run_id
dynamoDB stream picks this up
lambda receives dynamoDB stream event
lambda queries dynamoDB followers table using the username from the run item obtained from stream event
lambda pushes using connectionids

need to get past 10 events for feed, sorted by latest

dynamodb stream new images

#generate UUID for each run item
#convert using typedeserializer

front end needs to send the correct run item and location item.

locations
locations are not stored in db
someone starts a run, starts a run topic
someone clicks on map link, connects to run via websocket
use websockets on client to connect to a run id topic, save connection id and get events back
locations are pushed to client

if run has ended... update on frontend

websockets on frontend

make pure lambda functions in chalice for dynamoDB streams and hook them up

ask about dependencies
does this work? send a message in a websocket chalice lambda without decorator?

send to multiple connectionids

use SQS queue to store location objects so you dont have to store it in DB
lambda reads off SQS queue and pushes to connected ids
need to get ids of all people subscribed to this queue
